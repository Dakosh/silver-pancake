    <h2>How It All Started</h2>
    <p>Once I was an ordinary guy, spending nights solving math problems, working on computer science exercises, and building small frontend projects. From that moment, I realized:</p>
    <p><strong>If you work hard enough, even your code can lead to big changes in life.</strong></p>

<section id="career">
    <h2>Career Path in IT</h2>
    <p>I started my career as a frontend developer. I enjoyed turning ideas into <em>interfaces</em> that people use every day. First small projects, then work in a startup, and later in a large international corporation.</p>
    <p>I grew fast and achieved:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mastery of React, TypeScript, and project architecture</li>
        <li>Mentoring newcomers</li>
        <li>Contributing to large product systems</li>
        <li>First leadership roles</li>
    </ul>

<section id="entrepreneurship">
    <h2>First Steps in Entrepreneurship</h2>
    <p>Later, I realized: <em>writing code is great, but creating something of your own is even better</em>. That's how the idea of starting my own company emerged.</p>
    <p>At first, it was a small IT service solving a specific client problem. Within a few years, the business gained steady revenue, a team, products, and a reputation.</p>
    <p>Then I expanded beyond IT, opening several ventures aimed at delivering societal value, not just profit.</p>

    <p>Today, in retirement, I look back and realize I achieved the main goal: creating security for myself and my family while leaving a mark in the industry.</p>
    <p>My achievements include:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Mentored several generations of developers now working worldwide</li>
        <li>Built a company surviving over 20 years in the market</li>
        <li>Worked in international corporations and contributed to global projects</li>
        <li>Authored a series of articles and a couple of books on career, motivation, and personal effectiveness</li>
        <li>Maintained passion for new technologies even at 60</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
    <p>Success is not only about code, money, or business. It's about <em>discipline, persistence, and the courage to start over</em> without fear of change.</p>
